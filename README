BUGHOUSE - THE FOUR PLAYER CHESS GAME

What is Bughouse?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess

Why was this made?

This is a java project initially created for exploration into multithreading and
networking in java.

What is the program?

This program allows for a number of clients to connect to a server, with a basic
username, password, and rating system. Then every four players that look for a 
game are paired together and will start a new game.

What is it made in?

The client is written in Processing, a offshoot of java with simple graphics.
The server is written in pure java, because Processing requires an X windows server,
and the server I have access to does not have an X windows server.
